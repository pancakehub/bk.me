### let'sdoit

It was Tuesday, April 5th.

I entered the classroom, and the class started....

The topic was the challenging task of maintaining regular posting on their respective personal blogs.

They then decided to make a bet: either you maintain a regularity of 2 posts per week or you pay for a crate of beer.

<!-- more -->

At the time, they tried to convince me to join the bet as well, but of course, I refused. With so many things I already have to accomplish in my routine, it would be crazy to try to maintain a blog too.

A week later, during class, I saw a piece of twitter web request! O_O

At that moment, I was caught in a difficult dilemma: do I attend class or start developing something right now?

If you know me, you can guess that I stayed focused on that for the entire class, and then I got home and continued working on the final touches.

I still have a lot to improve here, but now at 1:19 AM, I officially enter the bet!
