**2024**
- **Cyclone Analysis**
  Developed a data analytics model to identify tropical cyclone centers using wind stress, wind curl, 
  and divergence analysis techniques. Employed with wind components data from EOS-6 satellite's 
  scatteromter L2B data in HDF5 format, applying advanced analytics methodologies to interpret 
  patterns and streamline cyclone center detection. Integration of these techniques enhanced 
  accuracy and efficiency in forecasting cyclone formation and behavior.

**2023**
- **Fiestel-P-VOL** Cryptography Algorithm
  Uses an old algorithm widely used in world war 1 and 2 to provide a highly secure communication 
  path. The system performs deciphering automatically without user interruption and encrypts
  plain text further in layers.

## Folder Structure

There are **4 main folders for Hugo-based sites**:

- `content/` for your Markdown-formatted content files (homepage, etc.)
  - `_index.md` the homepage (**Hugo requires that the homepage and archive pages have an underscore prefix**)
- `assets/`
  - `media/` for your media files (images, videos)
    - `icons/custom/` upload any custom SVG icons you want to use
- `config/_default/` for your site configuration files
  - `hugo.yaml` to configure Hugo (site title, URL, Hugo options, setup per-folder page features)
  - `module.yaml` to install or uninstall Hugo themes and plugins
  - `params.yaml` to configure Hugo Blox options (SEO, analytics, site features)
  - `menus.yaml` to configure your menu links (if the menu is enabled in `params.yaml`)
  - `languages.yaml` to configure your site's language or to set language-specific options in a multilingual site
- `static/uploads/` for any files you want visitors to download, such as a PDF
- `go.mod` sets the version of Hugo themes/plugins which your site uses


## Hugo File Naming Convention

Hugo gives us two options to name standard page files: as `TITLE/index.md` or `TITLE.md` where `TITLE` is your page name.

The page name should be lowercase and using hyphens (`-`) instead of spaces.

Both approaches result in the same output, so you can choose your preferred approach to naming and organizing files. A benefit to the folder-based approach is that all your page's files (such as images) are self-contained within the page's folder, so it's more portable if you wish to share the original Markdown page with someone.

The homepage is a special case as **Hugo requires the homepage and listing pages to be named** `_index.md`.

## Docs Navigation

The docs navigation is automatically generated based on the content in the `docs/` folder and is sorted alphabetically.

The order of pages can be changed by adding the `weight` parameter in the front matter of your Markdown files.

In the example below, the `example.md` page will appear before the `test.md` page as it has a lower `weight`:

Page `example.md`:

```yaml
---
title: My Example
weight: 1
---
```

Page `test.md`:

```yaml
---
title: My Test
weight: 2
---
```
