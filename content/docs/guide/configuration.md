*Growth. Hobbies. Time Waste.*

**What I Invest In**
In my free time, I love indulging in my favorite web series and movies, which allow me to escape into different worlds and enjoy captivating stories. Running is another passion of mine; it not only keeps me fit but also clears my mind and boosts my mood. Additionally, I find joy in reading comics, as they offer a perfect blend of art and storytelling, sparking my imagination and providing a fun way to unwind. These hobbies keep me balanced, energized, and inspired!
